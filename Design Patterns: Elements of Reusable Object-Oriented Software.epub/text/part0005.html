<p class="blockquote">“This is one of the best written and wonderfully insightful books that I have read in a great long while...this book establishes the legitimacy of patterns in the best way: not by argument but by example.”</p>
<p class="attribution"><strong class="calibre4">—Stan Lippman, <em class="calibre7">C++ Report</em></strong></p>
<p class="blockquote">“...this new book by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides promises to have an important and lasting impact on the discipline of software design. Because <em class="calibre7">Design Patterns</em> bills itself as being concerned with object-oriented software alone, I fear that software developers outside the object community may ignore it. This would be a shame. This book has something for everyone who designs software. All software designers use patterns; understanding better the reusable abstractions of our work can only make us better at it.”</p>
<p class="attribution"><strong class="calibre4">—Tom DeMarco, <em class="calibre7">IEEE Software</em></strong></p>
<p class="blockquote">“Overall, I think this book represents an extremely valuable and unique contribution to the field because it captures a wealth of object-oriented design experience in a compact and reusable form. This book is certainly one that I shall turn to often in search of powerful object-oriented design ideas; after all, that’s what reuse is all about, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="attribution"><strong class="calibre4">—Sanjiv Gossain, <em class="calibre7">Journal of Object-Oriented Programming</em></strong></p>
<p class="blockquote">“This much-anticipated book lives up to its full year of advance buzz. The metaphor is of an architect’s pattern book filled with time-tested, usable designs. The authors have chosen 23 patterns from decades of object-oriented experience. The brilliance of the book lies in the discipline represented by that number. Give a copy of <em class="calibre7">Design Patterns</em> to every good programmer you know who wants to be better.”</p>
<p class="attribution"><strong class="calibre4">—Larry O’Brien, <em class="calibre7">Software Development</em></strong></p>
<p class="blockquote">“The simple fact of the matter is that patterns have the potential to permanently alter the software engineering field, catapulting it into the realm of true elegant design. Of the books to date on this subject, <em class="calibre7">Design Patterns</em> is far and away the best. It is a book to be read, studied, internalized, and loved. The book will forever change the way you view software.”</p>
<p class="attribution"><strong class="calibre4">—Steve Bilow, <em class="calibre7">Journal of Object-Oriented Programming</em></strong></p>
<p class="blockquote"><em class="calibre7">“Design Patterns</em> is a powerful book. After a modest investment of time with it, most C++ programmers will be able to start applying its “patterns” to produce better software. This book delivers intellectual leverage: concrete tools that help us think and express ourselves more effectively. It may fundamentally change the way you think about programming.</p>
